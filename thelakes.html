            Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
            <br>I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you
            <br>Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
            <br>I'm setting off, but not without my muse
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <br>What should be over burrowed under my skin
            <br>In heart-stopping waves of hurt
            <br>I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
            <br>Tell me what are my words worth
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
            <br>I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you
            <br>Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
            <br>I'm setting off, but not without my muse
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>I want auroras and sad prose
            <br>I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
            <br>'Cause I haven't moved in years
            <br>And I want you right here
            <br>A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
            <br>With no one around to tweet it
            <br>While I bathe in cliffside pools
            <br>With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
            <br>I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you
            <br>Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
            <br>I'm setting off, but not without my muse
            <br>No, not without you
